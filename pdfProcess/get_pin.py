######## Image Object Detection Using Tensorflow-trained Classifier #########
#
# Author: Evan Juras
# Date: 1/15/18
# Description: 
# This program uses a TensorFlow-trained classifier to perform object detection.
# It loads the classifier uses it to perform object detection on an image.
# It draws boxes and scores around the objects of interest in the image.

## Some of the code is copied from Google's example at
## https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/object_detection_tutorial.ipynb

## and some is copied from Dat Tran's example at
## https://github.com/datitran/object_detector_app/blob/master/object_detection_app.py

## but I changed it to make it more understandable to me.

# Import packages
import os
import cv2
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
import sys

# This is needed since the notebook is stored in the object_detection folder.
sys.path.append("..")

# Path to frozen detection graph .pb file, which contains the model that is used
# for object detection.

# Number of classes the object detector can identify
NUM_CLASSES = 1

# Load the label map.
# Label maps map indices to category names, so that when our convolution
# network predicts `5`, we know that this corresponds to `king`.
# Here we use internal utility functions, but anything that returns a
# dictionary mapping integers to appropriate string labels would be fine
